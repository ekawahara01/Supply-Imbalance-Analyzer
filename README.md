## 📊 Overview

The **Supply Imbalance & Supply Decay Analyzer** is a specialized market diagnostic tool designed to answer one core question:

> **"Do existing solutions exist — and if so, are they structurally failing to serve the market?"**

Unlike traditional SEO tools that focus on *demand* (keyword volume, difficulty), this tool focuses entirely on **supply quality**. It detects markets where supply exists but is outdated, fragile, or structurally inefficient—signaling a prime opportunity for disruption.

## 🎯 Key Differentiators

| Traditional SEO Tools | Supply Imbalance Analyzer |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Focus on **Keyword Difficulty** | Focus on **Supply Fragility** |
| Measures **Domain Authority** | Measures **Supply Decay** |
| Identifies **Competitors** | Identifies **"Zombie Supply"** |
| "Can I rank?" | "Is the current market failing?" |

## 🧠 Core Metrics

### 1. Supply Health Score
A composite score (0-100) evaluating the structural integrity of the top search results.
*   **Dimensions**: Domain diversity, content freshness, maintenance signals.
*   **Verdict**:
    *   🔴 **Underserved** (<40): Supply is failing. Green light for entry.
    *   🟡 **Balanced**: Healthy market.
    *   🟢 **Saturated** (>80): Over-served. Avoid.

### 2. Supply Effort–Value Gap Index (SEVGI)
A proprietary metric to identify "Zombie Supply"—incumbents that rank due to legacy authority but deliver low value relative to their maintenance effort.

$$ \text{SEVGI} = \frac{\text{Content Complexity} \times \text{Maintenance Cost}}{\text{Search Visibility Outcome}} $$

*   **High SEVGI**: Identifies weak incumbents vulnerable to modern, efficient replacement.
