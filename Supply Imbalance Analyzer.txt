📘 Design Specification (Revised v2.0)
Supply Imbalance & Supply Decay Analyzer

(DataForSEO–Based Decision Tool)

1. Product Purpose & Core Question

Supply Imbalance & Supply Decay Analyzer is a decision-support tool designed to identify underserved or structurally failing markets by analyzing the quality, sustainability, and cost-efficiency of existing supply in search results.

The core question this tool answers is:

“Do existing solutions exist — and if so, are they structurally failing to serve the market?”

This tool is explicitly designed to detect functional supply shortages, not demand volume.

2. Key Differentiation (Why This Tool Exists)

Traditional SEO tools (e.g., Ahrefs, SEMrush) focus on:

Domain authority

Keyword difficulty

Competitive strength

This tool focuses instead on:

Supply health

Supply decay

Supply cost inefficiency

Maintenance fragility

It identifies markets where:

Supply exists but is outdated

Supply is overbuilt relative to value

Supply is fragile, homogeneous, or unsustainable

3. Delivery & Business Model
3.1 Sales Channel

Gumroad

One-time purchase

3.2 Delivery Method

Pre-configured Google Colab Notebook

No local setup

No server infrastructure

No coding required

3.3 User Promise

“From purchase to market verdict in under 5 minutes.”

4. API Architecture
4.1 Required API (Core Mode)

DataForSEO API (mandatory)

Used for:

SERP snapshots

Domain-level metrics

Page-level metadata

Content structure indicators

4.2 Optional API (Advanced Mode)

AI API (Gemini / OpenAI / others)

Optional

No affiliate integration

Used only for explanation and interpretation

Core analysis works fully without AI.

5. Analysis Architecture (Two-Layer Model)
Layer 1: Core Supply Analysis (Default)

Rule-based

Deterministic

Fully reproducible

AI-independent

Outputs:

Supply Health Score

Underserved / Balanced / Saturated classification

Structural failure indicators

Layer 2: AI-Enhanced Interpretation (Optional)

Adds:

Natural-language explanation

Supply failure reasoning

Strategic commentary

AI does not change the score, only the explanation.

6. Core Metrics & Logic
6.1 Supply Health Score (Primary)

Evaluates supply using measurable signals:

Domain diversity in SERP

Content freshness / decay

Update and maintenance signals

Supply homogeneity

Structural sustainability

6.2 New Core Metric:
Supply Effort–Value Gap Index (SEVGI)

This metric operationalizes the Gemini feedback regarding
“Content effort vs. apparent value.”

Definition (Conceptual)
SEVGI =
(Content Complexity × Maintenance Cost Signal)
÷
(Search Visibility Outcome)

DataForSEO Signals Used
Component	DataForSEO Signals
Content Complexity	HTML size, word count, image count
Maintenance Cost	Update frequency, page depth
Visibility Outcome	SERP position, snippet presence
Domain Strength	Domain rank
Interpretation

High effort + strong domains

Low visibility or weak differentiation

→ Zombie Supply Detected
(Overbuilt, underperforming, likely to decay)

This enables automatic detection of “weak incumbents.”

7. Supply Status Classification
Status	Meaning
Underserved	Supply exists but is failing structurally
Balanced	Supply is healthy and sustainable
Saturated	Supply is strong, maintained, and competitive
8. Efficiency Engine Integration (ROI Reinforcement)

To strengthen purchasing justification and DataForSEO retention,
the tool automatically injects a cost comparison insight.

Mandatory Output Block
Cost Efficiency Insight

This analysis required XX,XXX data points.
Estimated cost using traditional SEO platforms: $XX.XX
Actual cost using DataForSEO API: $0.XX
→ Cost reduction: 9X%


This block is:

Automatically generated

Shown on every analysis

Non-optional

Purpose:
Reinforce the economic superiority of DataForSEO on every use.

9. User Interface Requirements (Google Colab)
9.1 UI Principles

No code interaction

Form-based inputs only

Diagnostic report layout

Suitable for non-engineers

The notebook must feel like a professional market diagnostic report, not a developer tool.

9.2 Input UI (Forms)
Input	Type	Required
Target Keyword	Text	Yes
Market Scope	Dropdown	Yes
Analysis Mode	Radio (Core / Advanced)	Yes
DataForSEO API Key	Password	Yes
AI API Key	Password	Optional

Required UI Copy

No setup required.
Core analysis works without AI.

9.3 Execution UI

Single RUN ANALYSIS action

Natural-language progress messages:

Fetching supply data

Analyzing supply structure

Detecting supply decay

Calculating efficiency

9.4 Output UI (Diagnostic Report)
1. Verdict Panel (Top)
Supply Status: Underserved / Balanced / Saturated
Supply Health Score: XX / 100
Primary Structural Issue: Decay / Concentration / Overhead


Color-coded and visually prominent.

2. Visual Diagnostics

Supply Health Gauge

Radar chart (Diversity / Freshness / Maintenance / Efficiency)

Rendered automatically, no code visible.

3. Diagnostic Table
Indicator	Status	Insight
Supplier Diversity	Low	Same-type sites dominate
Content Freshness	Poor	Pages outdated
SEVGI	High	Zombie supply detected
4. Cost Efficiency Block

(See Section 8)

10. Actionable Expansion (Conditioned Output)
Trigger Condition

Supply Status = Underserved

Additional Output Section

Actionable Opportunities

Related low-competition keywords (DataForSEO)

Content clusters with weak supply

Optional CSV export

This section enables:

Direct action

Gumroad upsell potential

Domain and keyword monetization workflows

11. Trust & Transparency Requirements

Mandatory disclaimer:

This tool evaluates supply-side structure and sustainability.
It does not measure market size, revenue, or ranking difficulty.


No performance guarantees.
No predictive revenue claims.

12. Relationship to DataForSEO

This product is intentionally designed to:

Showcase what is uniquely possible with DataForSEO APIs

Encourage API-first analysis

Be impossible to replicate with UI-only SEO tools

It functions as:

A decision tool

A live DataForSEO demonstration

A conversion asset for DataForSEO adoption

13. Primary Use Cases

SaaS idea validation (pre-build)

SEO market entry screening

Detection of decaying SERPs

Underserved niche discovery

Competitive fragility analysis

Agency and consulting diagnostics

DataForSEO capability demonstration

14. Explicit Non-Goals

This tool does not aim to:

Replace SEO platforms

Optimize rankings

Predict revenue

Guarantee outcomes

Its purpose is decision clarity, not execution automation.

15. MVP Success Criteria

Clear GO / NO-GO signal within minutes

Only one mandatory API key

Non-technical users can interpret results

Low support burden

High DataForSEO perceived value

Final Statement

Supply Imbalance & Supply Decay Analyzer is designed to prevent bad investments by exposing markets where supply is already failing.

Its power lies not in prediction, but in revealing structural weakness before capital is committed.
